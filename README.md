# 8085 Simulator
This is an Intel 8085 Microprocessor Simulator in window like UI with Opcode-Instruction functions written solely in JavaScript.

### What makes it Unique?
The functions are written in JavaScript for every Opcode-Instruction that are available in a physical Intel 8085 Microprocessor which makes it unique from the rest of the Simulators on the Internet, as this is faster, reliable and being an open-source project the code is easily understandable and customisable as everything is entirely written in [Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vanilla+Javascript) along with description of all major code segments and declared variables.<br>
The window like UI makes it easier and user-friendly for both Desktop/Laptop and Mobile users with the ability to drag and move the various windows around the screen.<br>
For Windows-OS based [8085 Simulator](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/8085-Simulator.shtml) software users, it is easier to migrate to this as it is an exact clone of that.

### About Intel 8085 Microprocessor
Intel 8085 is an [8-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit) microprocessor produced by [Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel) and introduced in March 1976. It is a software-[binary compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code_compatibility) with the more-famous [Intel 8080](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) with only two minor instructions added to support its added interrupt and serial input/output features.
